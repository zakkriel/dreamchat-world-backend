-- migrate:up

-- ─── generate_perceptions — write about-ness (perception_subject) on EVERY branch ──────────
-- Ledger flag (RULINGS-2026-07-23 §6): the discovery-on-arrival loop was the ONLY branch
-- writing perception_subject; the Communicated/private_disclosure branch and the mover-direct
-- perception (move branch) got none, masked at seed time by a generic backfill in
-- seed_mara_0A.sql. Task 3's isolation lookup intersects subject links mechanically, so the
-- engine must write subjects itself — the mask is being deleted alongside this migration.
--
-- New semantics: every perception_record written by generate_perceptions carries
-- perception_subject rows for the source event's participants (event_participant), matching
-- the semantics the backfill provided. The discovery-on-arrival loop's existing explicit
-- subject write (the noticed actor) is untouched.
